## About Laravel-RESTAPI-Boilerplate

Laravel-RESTAPI-Boilerplate is the repository for developers to easily create their project with pre-installed Laravel-Passport authenication for default class "User" that laravel makes on first intialization of any new project.
This boilerplate has "UserController" that contains two sample function that use to register / login the user which is named as :
- **[authup]** -for register
- **[authin]** -for login


## About Laravel-Passport

Laravel already makes it easy to perform authentication via traditional login forms, but what about APIs? APIs typically use tokens to authenticate users and do not maintain session state between requests. Laravel makes API authentication a breeze using Laravel Passport, which provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for your Laravel application in a matter of minutes. Passport is built on top of the League OAuth2 server that is maintained by Andy Millington and Simon Hamp.
